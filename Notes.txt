1. Components:
    i. Name starts with an Uppercase Character:
        - Multi-word names must be written in PascalCase
        - It' recommended to pick a case that describes the UI building block.
        - Is written as a HTML tag.
        - Wraps built-in or other custom components
        - React traverses the component tree until it has only built-in components left
    ii. Returns "renderable" content
        - Mostly HTML content
    iii. Static content:
        - Content that's hardcoded to the JSX code
        - Can't change at runtime
    iv. Dynamic Code: 
        - Logic that produces the actual value that is added to JSX
        - Content/Value is derived at runtime
